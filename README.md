# Design Tokens Contrast Grid

Code for the [contrastgrid.eu](https://contrastgrid.eu/) website.

## Overview

The Contrast Grid tool helps you create a contrast table for your design tokens, allowing you to evaluate color contrast against a specific accessibility guideline. Unlike other contrast grid tools, the goal of this project is to make the process more accessible and to include regional accessibility specifications such as RGAA or RAAM.

## To do

- [ ] Add an explanation page to clarify different accessibility specifications.
- [ ] Add support for additional accessibility guideline options.
- [ ] Implement support for other contrast perception algorithms.
- [ ] Enable importing design tokens from a JSON file.
- [ ] Enable importing design tokens from TypeScript variables.
